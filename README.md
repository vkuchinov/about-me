Hi there,<br><br>
I am an experienced <u>senior digital designer</u> with a strong sense of typography, working on the edge of visual communications, creative coding and technologies â€” everything could be considered <i>generative</i> or <i>data-driven</i> design. 

My interest in creative coding are: generative 2D/3D graphics, polyargorithms, graph theory and everything could sharp quality of generative outcomes.
