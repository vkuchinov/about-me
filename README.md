<b><h1>about me</h1></b>
<i>a graphic designer who codes</i><br><br>
Hi there,<br><br>
I am experienced <u>senior designer</u> with a strong sense of typography, working on the edge of visual communications, creative coding and technologies â€” everything could be considered <i>generative</i> or <i>data-driven</i> design. 

My interest in creative coding are: generative 2D/3D graphics, polyargorithms, graph theory and everything could sharp quality of generative outcomes and objectionable reduce artefacts.
